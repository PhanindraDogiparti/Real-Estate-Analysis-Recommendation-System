# Real-Estate-Analysis-Recommendation-System

A modern and robust application for analyzing and recommending real estate properties using data science and machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- Comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for insights into property trends.
- **Recommendation System** powered by machine learning to suggest properties based on user preferences.
- Clustering algorithms like **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** for market segmentation.
- Dimensionality reduction using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.
- Interactive visualizations to simplify data understanding.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Algorithms:** K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, Content-Based Filtering

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` - Contains datasets used for analysis.
- `scripts/` - Core Python scripts for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `results/` - Outputs, visualizations, and final models.
- `README.md` - Documentation for the project.

## 📈 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify key trends in property attributes like price, size, and location.
3. **Modeling:** Implement clustering and recommendation algorithms.
4. **Evaluation:** Use metrics like Silhouette Score and Elbow Method for validation.

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
- Price vs. Bedrooms Scatter Plot
- Top Sq.Ft Distribution
- Optimal Clustering using Elbow Curve
